Committee,

Our nanoparticle delivery system has shown promising results:

- Particle size: 50-100nm
- Drug loading: 85% efficiency
- Controlled release over 48 hours
- Enhanced tissue penetration

I recommend we proceed with patent filing. The technology shows significant advantages over current methods.

Best,
Lisa

Lisa,

The results are encouraging. Before proceeding with the patent, we should:

1. Complete the biodistribution studies
2. Gather more stability data
3. Document the manufacturing process

Let's meet next week to discuss the patent strategy.

Michael
