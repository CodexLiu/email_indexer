Content:
Michael,

The biodistribution studies for our nanoparticle delivery system are complete:

- Liver accumulation: 15% reduction
- Target tissue uptake: 2.5x improvement
- Blood circulation time: 24 hours
- Renal clearance: Within safety parameters

These results support our novel targeting claims.

Lisa

Lisa,

The biodistribution data looks promising. Let's schedule a meeting with legal next week to discuss patent filing strategy. The improved tissue targeting with reduced liver accumulation is a significant advancement.

We should also prepare a competitive analysis comparing our results with existing delivery systems.
