Mark,

The 28Â°C validation tests are complete. Results:
- 96% activity retention after 15 months
- Consistent protein structure maintenance
- Minimal variation between batches (<2%)

This extends our temperature range claim and further differentiates our method from competitors.

Sarah,

Perfect timing. I'll incorporate this data into the final draft. The extended temperature range significantly strengthens our claims.

I've scheduled the internal review meeting for February 5th. Please block your calendar.

Best regards,
Mark
