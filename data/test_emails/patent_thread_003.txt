Subject: Patent Draft Review - Enzyme Stabilization Method

Content:
Sarah,

I've completed the first draft of the patent application for our enzyme stabilization method. Key sections include:

1. Background
2. Technical Description
3. Claims (20 total)
4. Examples and Data

Please review and let me know if any technical details need adjustment. We should aim to file by end of February.

Best,
Mark

Mark,

I've reviewed the draft with James. Overall, it looks good, but we have a few suggestions:

1. Expand claim 5 to cover the full temperature range (15-30°C)
2. Add specific examples from our 14-month stability study
3. Include the energy cost comparison data
4. Add details about the protein scaffold mechanism

Also, we have some new data showing even better stability at 25°C. Should we include this?

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

Excellent suggestions. I'll revise the draft to incorporate all these points. The new stability data at 25°C would strengthen our claims significantly - please send it over.

I've also added a new dependent claim specifically addressing the protein scaffold mechanism, as this appears to be a key differentiator from prior art.

I'll have the revised draft ready by February 15th, keeping us on track for month-end filing.

Best regards,
Mark
