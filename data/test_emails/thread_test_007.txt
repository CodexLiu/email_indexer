Sarah,

Excellent meeting today. I've incorporated all the committee's suggestions. The final draft will be ready for your review by February 12th, keeping us on track for month-end filing.

The comprehensive stability data across temperature ranges makes for a very strong patent application.

Best regards,
Mark
