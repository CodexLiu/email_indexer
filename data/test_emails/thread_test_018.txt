Michael,

The manufacturing protocol for the nanoparticle delivery system is ready:

1. Batch size: 100L validated
2. Process parameters optimized:
   - Temperature: 25±2°C
   - Mixing speed: 450 rpm
   - Particle size distribution: CV < 10%

Documentation is ready for patent inclusion.

Lisa,

The protocol looks good. Please add:
1. Equipment specifications
2. In-process controls
3. Critical quality attributes

We'll need this for both the patent application and eventual tech transfer.
