Mark,

I've reviewed the final draft. The technical content is accurate and comprehensive. A few minor suggestions:

1. Add the 500L scale-up validation data
2. Emphasize the 35% production cost reduction
3. Include the full temperature stability curve

Otherwise, it's ready for submission.

Sarah

Sarah,

Thanks for the quick review. I'll incorporate these changes today. The scale-up data and cost reduction figures will strengthen our commercial viability claims.

We're still on track for filing by month-end. I'll send you the updated draft tomorrow for final approval.

Best regards,
Mark
