James,

I've compiled all stability data for the final patent review:

Temperature Range Results:
- 15°C: 99% activity (15 months)
- 20°C: 98% activity (15 months)
- 25°C: 98% activity (15 months)
- 28°C: 96% activity (15 months)
- 30°C: 94% activity (15 months)

This comprehensive data set shows remarkable stability across the entire range.

Sarah

Sarah,

This is impressive. The consistency across temperatures is unprecedented. I've added comparative data from competitors:

- Company A: 85% activity at 20°C (6 months)
- Company B: 80% activity at 15°C (12 months)
- Company C: No room temp stability

We clearly have a superior technology. Ready for the review meeting on Monday.
