Robert,

Scale-up validation results for the new bioreactor:

- 2000L capacity achieved
- Oxygen transfer rate: 1.2 mmol/L/h
- Temperature control: ±0.2°C
- Energy consumption: 40% reduction

These results support moving forward with the patent application.

Emily

Emily,

Great results. I've scheduled a meeting with legal for next week to discuss the patent application. The energy reduction alone makes this technology valuable.

We should also prepare:
1. Detailed engineering drawings
2. Control system documentation
3. Comparative analysis with existing systems
