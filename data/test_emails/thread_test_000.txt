Team,

The latest stability tests at 25°C show even better results than expected:
- 98% activity retention after 15 months
- Protein structure fully preserved
- No degradation products detected

This strengthens our patent position significantly. I've shared these results with legal for inclusion in the application.

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

These results are outstanding. The 98% activity retention exceeds industry standards by a significant margin. I suggest we:

1. Run additional validation tests at 28°C
2. Document the cost savings implications
3. Prepare a comparative analysis with competitor products

This data will be crucial for both the patent and future commercialization.

James
