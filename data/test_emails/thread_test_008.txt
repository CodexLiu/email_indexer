Content:
Sarah,

The manufacturing team has completed the scale-up validation for the stabilized enzyme:

1. Batch size: 500L successful
2. Stability consistent with lab results
3. Production costs 35% lower than current method
4. All QC parameters within specification

This data supports our patent claims about commercial viability.

James

James,

Excellent results. I've forwarded this to Mark for inclusion in the patent application. The successful scale-up demonstration strengthens our claims significantly.

The 35% cost reduction exceeds our initial projections. This will be valuable for both the patent and future commercialization discussions.

Sarah
