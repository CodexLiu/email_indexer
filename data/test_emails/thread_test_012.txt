Mark,

The updated draft looks excellent. The additions strengthen our claims:

1. Scale-up data demonstrates commercial viability
2. Cost reduction figures show clear market advantage
3. Temperature stability curve supports broad claims

I approve this version for filing.

Sarah

Sarah,

Thank you for the quick approval. I'll begin the filing preparation process today. We should have everything ready for submission by February 20th, well ahead of our month-end target.

I'll keep you updated on the filing status.

Best regards,
Mark
