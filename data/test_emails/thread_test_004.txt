Subject: New Bioreactor Design Patent

Content:
Committee Members,

I'm proposing we file a patent for our new bioreactor design. Key features:

1. Novel agitation system
2. Improved oxygen transfer (30% better than standard)
3. Integrated cooling mechanism
4. Real-time monitoring capabilities

Initial testing shows significant yield improvements. Would like to discuss next steps.

Best,
Robert

Robert,

The design looks promising. Before proceeding with the patent application, we should:

1. Complete the scale-up validation
2. Document energy efficiency metrics
3. Prepare cost comparison with existing systems

Let's schedule a detailed review next week.

Best,
Emily
