Team,

We're moving forward with the patent application for our novel drug delivery system. Key innovations:

1. Targeted release mechanism
2. Improved bioavailability (45% increase)
3. Reduced side effects profile

Please review the attached technical specifications and provide feedback by Friday.

Best,
Michael

Michael,

I've reviewed the specifications. A few suggestions:

1. Include the pH-dependent release data
2. Add the stability studies in simulated gastric fluid
3. Expand on the particle size distribution analysis

The bioavailability improvement is particularly impressive. This could be a major advancement in oral drug delivery.

Best,
Lisa
