Mark,

I've completed the cost analysis for our stabilized enzyme production:

1. Storage cost reduction: 75% compared to refrigerated methods
2. Energy savings: ~$120,000 annually per facility
3. Reduced waste: 15% improvement in product lifecycle

Please include these figures in the patent's commercial advantages section.

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

This is excellent data for the commercial viability section. The energy savings alone make a compelling case. I'll add a specific claim about the cost-efficiency of room temperature storage.

The patent draft is nearly complete. We should be ready for internal review by end of week.

Best,
Mark
