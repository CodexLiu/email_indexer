I need to know your timeline on the project. How much longer will it take?

Hi Cody,

I understand you're looking for an update on the project timeline. We've encountered some challenges with the 50L production run that have impacted our original schedule. I can provide a more detailed review of where we stand:

- The 50L batch had to be terminated during the production phase
- We need to reassess the timeline for the subsequent 250L run and R&D trials
- The downstream processing steps (filtration, spray drying) are pending this review

Could we schedule a brief meeting to discuss these challenges and align on a revised timeline? I want to ensure we have a solid plan moving forward that accounts for the lessons learned from the 50L run.

Best,
Cody
