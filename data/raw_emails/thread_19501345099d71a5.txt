Hi Cody,

Yes, we should definitely meet to discuss the project and the challenges we've encountered with the 50L production run. I have two time slots available tomorrow:

9:00 AM - 11:00 AM
2:00 PM - 4:00 PM

Please let me know which time works best for you, and I'll send over a calendar invite right away. I think it's important we align on the revised timeline and discuss our next steps, particularly regarding the 250L run and downstream processing.

Best,
Cody
